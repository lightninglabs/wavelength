# lib/tree

## Purpose

VTXO tree construction, materialization, and MuSig2 signing session management.
Builds the Merkle-like transaction tree structure used in Ark rounds, from leaf
descriptors through branch nodes to the batch output.

## Key Types

- `Tree` — Complete VTXO or connector tree: root outpoint, root output, node hierarchy, and traversal helpers. Built via `BuildVTXOTree` or `BuildConnectorTree`.
- `Node` — Single tree node representing a transaction in the tree (branch or leaf).
- `LeafDescriptor` — Describes a single VTXO leaf: amount, owner pubkeys, cosigner keys, CSV delay.
- `VTXODescriptor` — Interface for VTXO metadata needed by tree construction (amount, cosigners, owner key).
- `ConnectorDescriptor` — Describes a connector output for forfeit transaction construction.
- `Structure` — Intermediate tree layout built by `BuildStructure` before materialization.
- `StructureConfig` — Configuration for tree building (radix, partition weight function).
- `SignerSession` — MuSig2 signing session for tree transactions, wrapping `input.MuSig2Signer`.
- `Materializer` / `BTCMaterializer` — Interface and implementation for materializing tree nodes into actual Bitcoin transactions.
- `TreeAssembler` — Two-pass builder (`BuildStructure` then `Materialize`) driven by `TreeConfig`.
- `Queue[T]` — Generic queue used internally for BFS tree traversal.

## Relationships

- **Depends on**: `lib/arkscript` (taproot script construction, policy templates, `SpendInfo`).
- **Depended on by**: `round` (tree construction/validation), `oor` (tree references), `db` (tree serialization).

## Invariants

- `DefaultRadix` is 2 (binary tree). Each internal node has at most 2 children.
- `NumLeafOutputs` is 2 per leaf transaction (VTXO output + sweep output).
- Cosigner keys must be deduplicated (`UniqueCosigners`) before computing the final MuSig2 key.
- Tree materialization is deterministic given the same leaf descriptors and operator key.
- `ValidateVTXODescriptors` / `ValidateConnectorDescriptor` must pass before tree construction.
- **Cache-aliasing invariant**: a `*Tree` is effectively immutable once published from
  a builder or resolver. Multiple downstream consumers may share the same `*Tree`
  pointer through caches and ancestry-fragment slices. Silently mutating a shared
  tree's nodes or root would corrupt every aliasing reader. Callers that need to
  transform a tree must clone it first.
